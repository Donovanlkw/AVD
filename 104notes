App Service Plan
- The app must be running in the Standard, Premium, or Isolated tier in order for you to enable multiple deployment slots. 
- If the app isn't already in the Standard, Premium, or Isolated tier, you receive a message that indicates the supported tiers for enabling staged publishing. At this point, you have the option to select Upgrade and go to the Scale tab of your app before continuing.
- Scale up: Get more CPU, memory, disk space, and extra features like dedicated virtual machines (VMs), custom domains and certificates, staging slots, autoscaling, and more.
- Creating one App Service Plan, you can support up to 10 Web Apps. Adding any of the other resources are pointless and not noted as a requirement.
